In this project I made that the world contain everything without ' ' , ',' , '.'.

As main data program have the "Text" represented like vector and "M" like map where key is word and value is vector of integers in witch sentences this word contains.

In first step program run through the given text and indentify words in upper case and sentences.
When the word end program get pointer to vector from map and adding number of this sentence I it first iteration of this number in that vector.

In second step Program get the word witch need to find in text. Translate it in to Upper case than get from map "M" vector of sentences.

In third step Program run through that sentences with splitting it in words and translating to in another variable upper cases of that word. After that if given word and that word are equal writing upper case else writing in form from variable "Text".
